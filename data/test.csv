Speaking of idiocy...I found this amusing: The former editor says, ""Social media has let loose all kinds of dark instincts that were lurking. When you thought it was just your own dark thoughts, and there was nobody who shared them, maybe you wouldn't have been so loud about them. But when you find there are a whole bunch of people who agree, it does give you volume.""

Social media doesn't care about the type of thoughts or instincts. Neither does MSM. It disseminates EVERYTHING, ""dark"" or ""light.""

In his haste to make sweeping generalizations and uphold stereotypes about all Germans, the writer forgets that Afd only got about 12%. OOOPS. 

Vaughn also seems to conveniently forget that Germany is a country in which over 22% of residents are not born in Germany. This fact completely and utterly destroys the writer's claims about inherent German xenophobia.

Vaughn's attempts to ground current German attitudes and behavior in Prussia and the Soviet occupation is like me trying to say that Canadians love to travel because of Canada's experience in the fur trade; or saying that Canadians are anti-American because of the war of 1812. Just plain stupid.

Vaughn should maybe get away from the Starbucks in Kreuzberg where he probably wrote this swill and actually learn something about Germans and their history and culture."

It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them."

Trucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.

Concurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.

Wrong again, Larry. People were called ignorant for being ignorant, and spreading false information taken from alt right websites without ever considering fact checking before parroting. (They should be called alt wrong websites.)

People were called racist for making racist comments, which of course were simply considered anti PC remarks by the racists. That's the racist way of being PC, ironic as that is, and it kind of brings us back to the ignorance thing, again.

[],"What I am hearing Annie...is the rep strategy is to pass very quickly some version of  ""repeal replace"" on the ACA but date it after the midterms....(and forget the ""replace"").

I cited some data from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .....that note to some degree the dependence of Medicare currently on the ACA....my understanding is that Ryan wants to deep six the whole deal i.e. No ACA, very limited MediCaid and MediCare replaced by vouchers....

Vouchers for Medicare are the equivalent of ""block grants"" for other human services delegated to individuals (block grants are generally delegated to the states). Block grants promise an improvement that they NEVER produce.

The truly naive (and stupid) buy into the rep/Ryan thought that these vouchers will be generous and you can purchase health care with them....

Simple.

Where is 'Merry Christmas' no longer allowed in this country? Where? Name one place -- one state, one municipality, one jurisdiction -- where people are prohibited from saying 'Merry Christmas.' Just one will do. 

I don't oppose Trump because he's conservative. In fact, if he were consistently conservative I might be able to muster some support for him. I oppose him because instead of doing things that matter he's content to pander to those who already agree with him. That's not leadership. It's cowardice and narcissism.

This 'Merry Christmas' nonsense will keep Trump's rabid fans fired up, but at the end of the day you and I both know nothing will change. Absolutely nothing."
