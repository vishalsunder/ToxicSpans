They gather the rocks,  pour gasoline (i.e. state money) onto the rocks, throw a match and BOOM - there comes a huge ball of fire, with plenty of heat and smoke. They immediately celebrate their collective genius and return to the house.  The next day they go outside and discover nothing but a pile of warm rocks. So what do the do?  They try again to get the granite rocks to burn and again they fail. 
 So then they decide that they chose the wrong type of rocks. So they gather shale rocks  which are a different color (yet  just as inert).  Proclaiming they have found the solution they pour even more gasoline (state money) onto this ""new"" pile of rocks and the cycle repeats itself with exactly the same results.
 Saddly,  until the gasoline (state money) runs out they never quit trying to get those rocks to burn."

I don't know what will happen, and no one knows. But one thing I do know is what goes up quickly goes down quickly as well. Look out below when the bottom drops out, not if but when. The fundamentals can only be submerged for so long.

This means he does not have the capacity for compassion and/or empathy, love and the understanding that we are interconnected and interdependent.  Sociopaths operate on adrenaline; the thrill of the adrenaline rush, power and conflict are what gets their interests and attention - it's about the only thing that does, since they don't have normal ""feelings."" Trump's tax plan would boost the wealthiest 1 percent- those who earn over $700,000.00 a year by about 13.5 percent.  The richest .1 percent would receive an average tax cut exceeding $1 million.  The middle income folks would receive an average $1,010.00 in tax cuts.  Trump is a typical lying politician; he says what he thinks people want to hear, then when elected, does what benefits him and his family.  Buyers remorse Trump voters?"

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.

Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.

A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.

I'll have you know, NP5491, that I chose those words very, very carefully. 

I watched, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that Trump is an idiot.

Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.

One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not)."

 Solution:  Take the majority away from them.  How?  By voting out any of your own legislators that are in the majority.  Even though they might be reasonably good reps, if they're in the majority, they're part of the problem because they empower the likes of Chenault and his cronies.
