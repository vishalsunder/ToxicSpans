Thank you regulatory board for saving us from potentially health inducing substances.

So we have a board and regulatory agency that is helpless to compete with the ""grey"" market.  We have a new director who insanely targets patients and our own pseudo tax collectors,  and leaves the black market to millions of dollars while the health food stores sell 38 brands of CBD by the shelf full.

The inmates have indeed taken over the asylum.

Do they not know they can send a memo and have the products get registered?  This is maddeningly idiotic and shameful on the part of this new director.
