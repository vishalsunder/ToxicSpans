Slavery was a part of the Confederacy just as it was part of the Union.  Lincoln stated clearly that he would rather have slavery and keep the Union, than have manumission and not keep the Union.

You lend new meaning to the concept of ""ignorant arrogance.""  Lee's will freed his slaves and he was against the institution of slavery.

Whipping was a common punishment at the time.  Freemen as well as slaves were frequently whipped.  Andrew Johnson was frequently whipped as a young man for his misdeeds.

When the Army of Northern Virginia invaded PA, they did not rape, steal, vandalize, and murder civilians as the Yank armies did throughout the South.  Their civility was due to Southern commanders like General Lee.

Obama refused to even refer to Islamic terrorists, even after they carried out horrible atrocities at Fort Hood, Paris, and Brussels.  After the Brussels' bombing Obama celebrated by doing the wave with Raoul Castro and then flying down to Rio for tango lessons.  After an American was beheaded, Obama gave a quick statement and then hopped into his golf cart grinning.

By doing nothing about NK Obama allowed Kim's nuclear proliferation program to increase rapidly;  China has been able to build illegally unsinkable aircraft carriers in the South China Sea to threaten sea lanes and control natural resources thanks to Obama's inaction.

Obama, Nuland, Clinton, and Kerry are directly responsible for the debacle in the Ukraine.  With the help of neo-Nazis, they orchestrated the overthrow of a legitimate government.

Obama did not enforce his Syrian red line.
